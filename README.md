# Working-with-Peaks-in-R
Presentation and example code for the Helmholtz Chromatin Summer School 2022

Find the presentation slides in the ./presentation folder.
Start with the "Introduction to Bioconductor and R" for a general introduction including some notes on working reproducibly in R. 
Afterwards dive into the "Working with peaks in R".

The second presentation is accompanied by to Rmarkdown documents (and respective HTML reports):
1. **ImportPeaks.Rmd** takes you into a small excercise of different peak file formats and how to read them into R. 
It also covers peak filtering and convertion into GenomiRanges.

2. **PeakOverlapsAndAnnotation.Rmd** covers more advanced operations on GRangeLists, peak annotation to Genomic features and biological functions.
I also added a discussion on different gene annotation resources, as well as differnet opinions on peak overlaps and reproducible peak definitions.
